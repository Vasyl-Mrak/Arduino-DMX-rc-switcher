This device is designed to control the RF Remote Control Relay Switch using the DMX protocol and radio signals 433mhz (315mhz). It uses buttons to select a DMX channel and saves its value to the EEPROM memory for later use. It also displays the selected channel on a 4-digit display and sends radio signals depending on the DMX value.
